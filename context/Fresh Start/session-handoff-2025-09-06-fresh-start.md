# Session Handoff - Fresh Start Approach - 2025-09-06

## Overview

Today we successfully completed a fresh start of the A-Riff-In-React project with a modernized architecture that addresses the previous deployment issues. We've moved away from the problematic IISNode configuration that was causing syntax errors to a more robust TypeScript Express API structure.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **API Restructuring**:
   - Created a proper TypeScript Express API with a clean architecture
   - Implemented services for both SQL Database and Cosmos DB
   - Set up proper Managed Identity authentication for Azure services

2. **Infrastructure Fixes**:
   - Updated web.config for better Node.js version control in App Service
   - Created proper CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
   - Fixed authentication issues with Key Vault and database connections

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Added proper configuration for local development
   - Created documentation for setup and deployment
   - Successfully tested the API locally with working health endpoint

## Technical Details

### API Structure
- Using TypeScript with modern ES modules
- Express framework with proper routing
- Service layer abstraction for data access
- Support for both relational (SQL) and NoSQL (Cosmos DB) data

### Authentication
- Managed Identity for Azure resources in production
- Local development credentials for testing
- Proper error handling and logging

### Deployment
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- Proper bundling and deployment package structure
- Configuration for Azure App Service

## Next Steps

1. Complete the frontend integration with the new API
2. Set up monitoring and logging in Azure
3. Implement unit and integration tests
4. Add authorization middleware
5. Complete the remaining API endpoints

## Resolved Issues

1. ✅ Fixed IISNode syntax error issues by upgrading to modern ES modules
2. ✅ Fixed Key Vault access by properly configuring Managed Identity
3. ✅ Improved deployment package with proper web.config
4. ✅ Created clean API architecture with proper TypeScript configuration

## Notes for Next Session

The API is now running successfully locally. The next session should focus on integrating the frontend React application with this API and completing the remaining backend features.
