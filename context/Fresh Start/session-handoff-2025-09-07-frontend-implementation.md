# Session Handoff - Frontend Implementation - 2025-09-07

## Overview

Today we continued the Fresh Start implementation by addressing the missing frontend code. The GitHub Actions deployment for the frontend was failing because the React application structure was completely missing from the repository. We've now implemented a basic Vite-based React TypeScript application structure to resolve this issue.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Frontend Structure Implementation**:
   - Created a basic Vite React TypeScript project structure
   - Added essential configuration files (tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts)
   - Implemented minimal React components to test the build process
   - Successfully built the React application locally

2. **Deployment Pipeline Progress**:
   - Fixed the initial build error (missing package-lock.json)
   - Fixed the second build error (missing frontend code)
   - Identified the next issue with Azure authentication credentials

3. **Infrastructure Integration**:
   - Configured Vite to output to the "build" directory to match the deployment workflow
   - Set up environment variable handling in vite.config.ts
   - Prepared for Azure Static Web App deployment

## Technical Details

### Frontend Structure
- Using Vite for modern build tooling
- TypeScript for type safety
- React 18 for the UI
- CSS modules for styling
- Environment variable configuration for API endpoints

### Current Status
- Frontend code structure is now in place
- Build process is successful
- GitHub Actions workflow can successfully complete the build step
- Next issue is with Azure authentication credentials in GitHub secrets

### Deployment Issues
1. ✅ Fixed missing package-lock.json issue
2. ✅ Fixed missing frontend code structure
3. ❌ Need to configure Azure authentication credentials in GitHub secrets

## Next Steps

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   - Create an Azure service principal for GitHub Actions
   - Add the service principal credentials as a GitHub secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
   - Add the `EXTERNAL_CLIENT_ID` and `EXTERNAL_TENANT_ID` secrets for authentication
   - Add the `STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` for Azure Static Web Apps deployment

2. **Complete Frontend Implementation**:
   - Implement authentication with Microsoft Entra External ID
   - Connect frontend to the Container Apps API
   - Implement full application features based on requirements

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the complete application locally
   - Verify the deployment pipeline with the correct credentials
   - Validate the integration between frontend and backend

## Technical Notes

The GitHub Actions workflow is using the following authentication method:

```yaml
- name: Login to Azure
  uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
```

This requires a service principal with the following JSON structure to be stored in GitHub secrets:

```json
{
  "clientId": "<GUID>",
  "clientSecret": "<STRING>",
  "tenantId": "<GUID>",
  "subscriptionId": "<GUID>"
}
```

Additionally, for the Microsoft Entra External ID authentication, the workflow needs:

```yaml
env:
  REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.EXTERNAL_CLIENT_ID }}
  REACT_APP_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.EXTERNAL_TENANT_ID }}
```

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress by implementing the missing frontend structure, which has resolved the build issues in the deployment pipeline. The next critical step is to configure the Azure authentication credentials in GitHub secrets to enable successful deployment to Azure Static Web Apps.
