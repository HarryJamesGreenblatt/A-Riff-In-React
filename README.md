# A Riff In React

## 📢 Front Page News: Current Progress Update

**Date:** 2025-08-31

**Latest Achievement:** ✅ **Microsoft Entra External ID Authentication - FULLY WORKING**

**Summary:** Authentication system is now completely functional! Users can successfully log in with Microsoft credentials, tokens are properly managed, and user profiles are displayed. The frontend authentication flow is production-ready. Next steps: Deploy Azure Functions backend and complete the full-stack integration.

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Microsoft login/logout flow
- ✅ Token acquisition and management
- ✅ User profile display
- ✅ Redux state management
- ✅ Secure redirect-based authentication

**Next Priority:** Backend API deployment to complete full-stack functionality

A modern, production-ready React application template demonstrating hybrid Azure SQL Database + Cosmos DB architecture.

## 🎯 Project Vision

**A Riff In React** is a general-purpose, production-ready React template that demonstrates best practices for modular architecture, Azure deployment, and polyglot persistence using both Azure SQL Database and Cosmos DB. This template is designed to be reusable for a variety of business scenarios, providing a solid foundation for scalable, maintainable, and Azure-ready web applications.

> _This template's modular structure and deployment patterns are inspired by the Application Factory Pattern and Blueprint Modularity described in [A Fugue In Flask](https://github.com/HarryJamesGreenblatt/A-Fugue-In-Flask)._

While the template includes example modules (such as user management and activity logs) to illustrate hybrid database patterns, it is not tied to any specific domain. Example scenarios, such as a running club management app, are provided in the documentation to demonstrate how to extend the template for real-world use cases.

## 📈 Development Progress
