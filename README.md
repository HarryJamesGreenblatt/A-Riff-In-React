## 📢 Front Page News: API Routing Architecture Fixed

**Date:** 2025-09-01

**Latest Achievement:** ✅ **Major Backend Progress - 404 → 500 (Routing Fixed!)**

**Breaking Progress:** Fixed critical Azure Function routing mismatch preventing API access. TypeScript compilation errors also resolved!

**What's Working Now:**
- ✅ Microsoft Entra ID authentication system working perfectly (local + production)
- ✅ Azure Function App deployed and responding (health checks return 200 OK)
- ✅ API routing architecture fixed (no more 404 errors on endpoints)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation errors resolved (@types/express, @types/cors added)
- ✅ Environment variables properly accessible in Azure Functions
- 🔄 Database connection debugging in progress (500 errors - connection issue)

**Current Focus:** Database connection troubleshooting for final API functionality

**Architecture Fix:** 
- **Problem**: Double `/api` prefix in routing (Function name + Express routes)
- **Solution**: Updated Express routes from `/api/users` → `/users` to work with Azure Function routing
- **Result**: Endpoints now receiving requests properly (progress from 404 to 500 errors)

**Next Step:** Database connection resolution to complete end-to-end functionality

A modern, production-ready React application template demonstrating hybrid Azure SQL Database + Cosmos DB architecture.

## 🎯 Project Vision

**A Riff In React** is a general-purpose, production-ready React template that demonstrates best practices for modular architecture, Azure deployment, and polyglot persistence using both Azure SQL Database and Cosmos DB. This template is designed to be reusable for a variety of business scenarios, providing a solid foundation for scalable, maintainable, and Azure-ready web applications.

> _This template's modular structure and deployment patterns are inspired by the Application Factory Pattern and Blueprint Modularity described in [A Fugue In Flask](https://github.com/HarryJamesGreenblatt/A-Fugue-In-Flask)._

While the template includes example modules (such as user management and activity logs) to illustrate hybrid database patterns, it is not tied to any specific domain. Example scenarios, such as a running club management app, are provided in the documentation to demonstrate how to extend the template for real-world use cases.
