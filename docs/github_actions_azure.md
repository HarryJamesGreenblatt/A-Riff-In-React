# GitHub Actions: Azure CI/CD Pipeline

**Status**: âœ… **SUCCESSFULLY CONFIGURED AND RUNNING**

This document covers the GitHub Actions workflow for **A Riff In React**, which successfully deploys the application and its infrastructure to Azure. The pipeline is optimized for cost-efficiency by deploying to a shared SQL Server.

## ðŸŽ‰ Current Status

- âœ… **Workflow Status**: Fully operational and tested.
- âœ… **Last Deployment**: Successful - August 30, 2025.
- âœ… **Live Application**: https://a-riff-in-react.azurewebsites.net
- âœ… **Authentication**: Microsoft Entra External ID integrated.
- âœ… **Infrastructure**: Deploys to a shared SQL Server in a separate resource group.

## Active Workflow: `azure-deploy.yml`

We use a **single, combined workflow** that handles both infrastructure and application deployment. This streamlined process was recently updated to handle the cross-resource-group deployment required by the shared database architecture.

### Workflow Features
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Deploys Azure resources using Bicep.
- **Cross-Resource Group Deployment**: Correctly deploys the SQL database to the shared server's resource group.
- **React Application Build**: Compiles the TypeScript application.
- **Azure App Service Deployment**: Pushes the built application to the hosting environment.
- **CI/CD Best Practices**: Uses a Service Principal with subscription-level permissions to manage resources across multiple resource groups.

## Required GitHub Secrets

The CI/CD pipeline requires a Service Principal with sufficient permissions. Because the deployment targets two different resource groups (`riffinreact-rg` for the app and `db-rg` for the database), the Service Principal must have the **Contributor** role assigned at the **Subscription** scope.

1.  **Create the Service Principal**:
    ```bash
    # Create a service principal with Contributor role over the entire subscription
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "GitHub-A-Riff-In-React" --role contributor \
      --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id} \
      --sdk-auth
    
    # The output is a JSON object. Copy it.
    ```

2.  **Add GitHub Secrets**:
    Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository's settings:
    *   `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: Paste the entire JSON output from the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command.
    *   `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Your Azure subscription ID.
    *   `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`: The primary resource group for this project (e.g., `riffinreact-rg`).
    *   `SHARED_SQL_SERVER_RG`: The resource group of the shared SQL server (e.g., `db-rg`).
    *   `SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The administrator password for the shared SQL server.

## Workflow Detail (`.github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml`)

The workflow uses a direct Azure CLI command (`az deployment group create`) for the Bicep deployment. This was a necessary change to overcome a limitation in the `azure/arm-deploy` action when dealing with module deployments that have a cross-resource-group scope.

This setup ensures a robust, secure, and cost-effective deployment pipeline for the application.
