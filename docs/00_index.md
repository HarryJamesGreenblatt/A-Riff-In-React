## ðŸ”„ Document Maintenance

### Recently Reorganized (September 6, 2025)
- Fixed duplicate numbering (02-architecture vs 02-development-setup)
- Moved provider registration before deployment (critical dependency)
- Consolidated local development guides
- Improved logical flow and grouping

### Contributing to Documentation
- Follow the numbered structure for new documents
- Update cross-references when adding new content
- Keep the README updated with new sections
- Test all links and commands before committing

## ðŸ“‹ Cross-References

### Key Dependencies
